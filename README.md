# VirtualMemory_Simulator
This is just a simple program written in Python. I developed this program, just to get me started and motivated for more bigger projects.

This program aims to help demonstrates how virtual memory works in an operating system. This program has been tested in Windows 11, but considering it's Python, it could probably work on a potato :) .

## Running the Program with Terminal / Command Prompt (For All OS)
(NOTE : Make sure you have Python libraries installed)
1. Run the program using:
   python virtualmem.py / py virtualmem.py

3. You may try out these commands in the prompt :
(NOTE : X and Y are decimal numbers)
  read x — reads data from virtual address (x)
  write x y — writes value you entered (y) to virtual address (x)
  mem — shows current physical memory usage
  table — shows the full page table and page data
  exit — closes the program

## You can also run the Python file using PyCharm or any other similar Python IDE's.
