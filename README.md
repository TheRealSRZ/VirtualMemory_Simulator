# VirtualMemory_Simulator
This is just a simple program written in Python. I developed this program, just to get me started and motivated for more bigger projects.

This program aims to help demonstrates how virtual memory works in an operating system. This program has been tested in Windows 11, but considering it's Python, it could probably work on a potato :) .
